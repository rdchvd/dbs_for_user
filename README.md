# dbs_for_user
The project helps user to easily interact with some types of databases without special knowledge of programming languages or sql commands.
At the moment the project is under development, therefore its functionality and general appearance is very disturbing. If you still want to enjoy its functionality, perform the following actions:
1. CREATING AND ACTIVATING VENV
I would advise you to create a virtual environment and only then install the following packages. It’s easy, it takes a little time, but it’s very useful. Of course, you can install everything in your system directories and do not bother with this step.
On Windows there are just two commands:
Open terminal in the directory with project and write there:
py -m venv name_of_virtual_environment_directory
and then
name_of_virtual_environment_directory/Scripts/activate.bat
then in your terminal u'll see (name_of_virtual_environment_directory) c:\path\to\working\directory
2. INSTALL SOME PACKAGES
Write on terminal the following:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. RUN
Now you can run the program through the terminal or in any other way you like. At this stage of development, there are two files:
-mysql.py to work with mysql
-postgre.py - i think u understand for what:)
But program is changing every day so wait and it will be one and more useful py-file.
