# dbs_for_user
The project helps user to easily interact with some types of databases without special knowledge of programming languages or sql commands.
At the moment the project is under development, therefore its functionality and general appearance is very disturbing. If you still want to enjoy its functionality, perform the following actions:
1. CREATING AND ACTIVATING VENV
Open terminal in the directory with project and write there:

py -m venv name_of_virtual_environment_directory

and then

name_of_virtual_environment_directory/Scripts/activate.bat

then in your terminal u'll see (name_of_virtual_environment_directory) c:\path\to\working\directory
2. INSTALL SOME PACKAGES
Write on terminal the following:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. RUN
python3 mysqll.py
